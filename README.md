C# Mastery is a 30 day journey designed for developers who want not only to learn C# but to master it.
Each day focuses on a specific concept (such as Switch Statements, Loops, OOP, Delegates, LINQ, Async/Await) and builds a self-contained project around it.
Project 1: Smart Calculator
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The Smart Calculator is the first project in the C# Mastery series.
Itâ€™s designed to reinforce the fundamentals of control flow, data structures, and object-oriented thinking by building a fully functional console-based calculator.
Instead of writing plain procedural code, this project introduces structured design using classes, structs, and constructors â€” bridging logic with clean architecture.
